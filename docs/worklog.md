Task ID: 1
Agent: main
Task: M0.5 — full upstream runtime analysis (MC 26.3, Paper 26.3, NeoForge 1.21.1, vanilla client 26.3, cross-version gap)

Work Log:
- Pulled ground truth from mojang piston-meta, PaperMC fill v3, maven.neoforged.net, mcmeta (branch `registries`), vanilla client/server jars.
- Wrote docs/runtime-analysis/{README,minecraft-26-3,paper-26-3,neoforge-1-21-1,vanilla-client-26-3,cross-version-gap}.md.
- Verified F2V v2 primitives exist in 26.3 (block/item/text_display, custom_model_data + item_model, filled_map, server resourcepacks fmt 97.1).
- Built CI matrix (ci/integration/profiling/visual) — green.

Stage Summary:
- Paper 26.3: protocol 777, DataVersion 5023, datapack v121.0, resourcepack v97.1, Java 25, build 223.
- NeoForge 1.21.1: 21.1.265, protocol 767, DataVersion 3955, Java 21, FML 4.0.45, eventbus 8.0.2, mixin 0.16.4.
- Mojmap runtime everywhere in NeoForge 1.21.1 → relocation is a pure mechanical rename.
- Cross-version gap measured (registries table in cross-version-gap.md).

Task ID: 2
Agent: main
Task: M1 — embedded vanilla 1.21.1 layer boots (shadow namespace relocation of the real NeoForge stack)

Work Log:
- crates/cim-reloc: relocation tables + full class-file rewriter (constant pool + member declaration descriptors, appended-UTF8 strategy).
- JNI bridge NativeReloc (Rust in libimagine.so); ShadowClassLoader (hermetic, child-first, central-dir index, MR-JAR-aware, legacyClassPath order).
- CI installs real NeoForge 21.1.265 server layer; relocated Bootstrap.bootStrap() runs inside Paper JVM headless; registry census 78 (local) / ≥70 asserted in CI.
- ground-truth.yml: server class census 26.3 vs 1.21.1 (7436 vs 6148) + 26.3 client decompile pipeline (client.txt → tiny v2 → tiny-remapper → Vineflower), validated locally.

Stage Summary:
- Commits 558eeb2 + 80f0a9c. All 5 workflows green on 80f0a9c.
- FmlStateShim seeds empty LoadingModList — replaced by real FML discovery in M2.

---
Task ID: 3
Agent: main
Task: M2 — mod execution: real FML discovery + mod relocation + cimtest registration through the layer; early real-mod integration (owner requirement)

Work Log:
- Sandbox reset detected (workspace lost); environment restored from GitHub (80f0a9c).
- Restored: rustup, NeoForge 21.1.265 server layer (installer), neoforged/NeoForge 1.21.1 source clone (FML sources for analysis), real NeoForge 1.21.1 mods from Modrinth.
- Analyzed FML 1.21.1: fml-loader discovery pipeline, fml-core ModContainer/FMLJavaModLoadingContext/eventbus wiring (see repo docs/runtime-analysis updates + M2 design in ARCHITECTURE).
- Implemented M2 (see subsequent entries).

Stage Summary:
- (in progress)

Task ID: 3.1
Agent: main
Task: M2 deep analysis — real FML 1.21.1 hosting design (loader-4.0.45 + bus-8.0.5 + neoforge-21.1.265 sources)

Work Log:
- Downloaded + extracted FML sources: maven.neoforged.net fancymodloader/loader-4.0.45, bus-8.0.5, modlauncher-11.0.5, neoforge-21.1.265 sources.
- Traced the real server mod-loading pipeline: ServerModLoader.load → CommonModLoader.begin/load/finish → ModLoader.gatherAndInitializeMods → RegistryManager.postNewRegistryEvent (mod buses) → GameData.unfreezeData/postRegisterEvents/freezeData → FMLCommonSetupEvent/FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent → NeoForge.EVENT_BUS.start().
- Key facts: FMLModContainer(IModInfo, entrypoints, ModFileScanData, ModuleLayer) — allowed ctor args {IEventBus, ModContainer, FMLModContainer, Dist}; exactly 1 public ctor. AutomaticEventSubscriber.inject uses scan data + FMLLoader.getBindings().getGameBus(). BusBuilder: mod bus = markerType(IModBusEvent)+allowPerPhasePost; game bus NeoForge.EVENT_BUS = startShutdown + IModBusEvent checker; post() on shutdown bus is a no-op; start() after registration.
- FMLLoader statics are package-private but reflective-seedable: dist, gameLayer, loadingModList, bindings (IBindingsProvider → Proxy → NeoForge.EVENT_BUS), backgroundScanHandler.
- Real ModFile(SecureJar.from(modjar), parser, attrs) → ModFileParser.modsTomlParser (real NightConfig toml parsing!) → real ModFileInfo/ModInfo. ModList.of(modFiles, sortedInfos) + setLoadedMods (reflective).
- ModFileScanData.AnnotationData records + asm Type — we build from Rust scan (relocated class names).
- Discovery of entrypoints = scan data @Mod targets → we supply RELOCATED names from cim-modscan.
- Decision (M2.0): own orchestration loop calling the REAL FML pieces (ModFile/ModFileInfo/ModInfo/ModList/FMLModContainer/AutomaticEventSubscriber/RegistryManager/GameData/DeferredWorkQueue) on a real ModuleLayer built over ShadowClassLoader via ModuleLayer.defineModules with custom ModuleDescriptors (per-mod module, packages = original + relocated).
- Known limit M2.0: runtime annotation descriptors stay raw (JVM reflection sees no @Mod on shadow classes) — harmless for construct path; ASM-based mod self-scanning (JEI plugin discovery) unaffected. M2.1 toggle: relocate runtime-visible annotation descriptors.

Stage Summary:
- M2.0 = real FML on our runtime, glue ≈ 1 orchestrator class + ModuleLayer factory + loader jar extension + Rust manifest pipeline.

Task ID: 3.2
Agent: main
Task: M2.0 bring-up on real mods — registration pipeline diagnostics + fixes; CI-first workflow established

Work Log:
- Sandbox survived partially this time; uncommitted M2 glue (~1500 lines) committed and pushed FIRST (afaa438) per owner's push-often directive.
- LocalHarness end-to-end bring-up: init (relocation armed, layer boot, mod jars into shadow loader, defineLayerEarly) -> loadMods (FmlHost.run).
- First failure: NewRegistryEvent left neoforge:* registries pending — root cause: manifest lacked the layer "neoforge" mod (prepend_layer_neoforge requires CIM_LAYER_DIR env; cim-manifest invocation missed it).
- Traced real NeoForge 21.1.265 sources: NeoForgeRegistries.<clinit> eagerly builds registries (RegistryBuilder.create -> trackModdedRegistry); NeoForgeMod ctor attaches NeoForgeRegistriesSetup handlers to its MOD bus; postNewRegistryEvent posts in mod order -> registration clears pending set.
- After CIM_LAYER_DIR fix: all 7 containers constructed (5 real Modrinth mods + jarjar mezz_config + neoforge 21.1.265 universal + ClientNeoForgeMod dist-skipped).
- Registration looked empty (registered={}, moddedEntries=[]) — diagRegisterProbe added to FmlHost (-Dcim.diag=true): ModList identity ok, buses ok, manual RegisterEvent(ITEM) post ok. Insight: the 5 real mods register NOTHING via RegisterEvent (behavioral mods) — empty delta is CORRECT.
- Added cimtest (rebuilt via javac against the mojmap layer jars — offline path) -> full registration verified: registered={ITEM=1,BLOCK=1,BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE=1,ENTITY_TYPE=1}, moddedEntries=[cimtest:test_block, cimtest:test_block_entity, cimtest:test_entity]. Real FML pipeline (NewRegistryEvent -> unfreeze -> RegisterEvent per registry in mod order -> freeze) works end-to-end in the shadow space.
- Fixed FmlHost index-pairing bug: mods skipped by dist filter desynced (mods, containers) parallel loops (IndexOutOfBoundsException) -> containerMods paired list.
- Full composite run: 8 mods (JEI 19.70.0.460, Jade 15.10.6, AppleSkin 3.0.9, FerriteCore 7.0.3, spark 1.10.124 + jarjar mezz_config + neoforge universal + cimtest) — mod execution ok in ~720 ms.

Stage Summary:
- M2.0 = real FML hosting works on real NeoForge 1.21.1 mods: discovery, JPMS layer, containers, ctor injection, AutomaticEventSubscriber, NewRegistryEvent, per-registry RegisterEvent, freeze, setup events, game bus start.
- Next: CI job for the M2 harness (all builds/tests on GitHub CI), push, then M2 parity (real NeoForge ground-truth server) + M2.1 runtime-visible annotations.

Task ID: 3.3
Agent: main
Task: CI-first hardening — clippy/-D-warnings clean, fmt clean, harness script, live-boot real-mod job

Work Log:
- ci.yml failure diagnosed: cargo fmt --check + clippy -D warnings on the uncommitted-to-legacy M2 glue.
- Fixed 10 clippy warnings (needless unwrap after is_some, too_many_arguments allowances with rationale, unused imports/variables, unused doc comment -> plain comment, complex type -> MethodAnnSpec alias, dead_code allowance for symmetric writer).
- cargo test --workspace: 81 tests green.
- scripts/run-m2-harness.sh: single entry point (cim-manifest + LocalHarness) for local + CI.
- integration.yml: m2-real-mods CI job (real Modrinth mods + cimtest, marker assertions, timing) + boot job now loads real mods through the LIVE Paper/CRUSSTY boot with registration assertions.
- Verified harness after rewriter edits: mod execution ok, 716 ms, same registrations.

Stage Summary:
- Pushed a09b861 (live-boot job) + clippy/fmt hardening. All builds/tests now owned by GitHub CI; sandbox does only light edits.
- Watching: ci + integration (boot w/ real mods, harness) on a09b861.

Task ID: 3.4
Agent: main
Task: CI validation round 1 — m2-real-mods harness job GREEN; boot assertion format fix

Work Log:
- m2-real-mods job (Modrinth mods + cimtest through real FML in shadow space): SUCCESS on first run.
- boot job failed on a STALE marker assertion: ready line is now nested JSON
  {"init":{...,"layer":{...}},"mods":{...}} but the check expected the old flat {"state":"ok"}.
  The live boot itself PASSED: layer registries=78, mods=8 in 736 ms, registered={ITEM=1,BLOCK=1,BLOCK_ENTITY_TYPE=1,ENTITY_TYPE=1}, moddedEntries=[cimtest:*].
- Rewrote the assertion step to parse the nested JSON robustly (raw_decode + per-key assertions), validated against the real CI boot.log artifact.
- ci.yml green on 8775439 (fmt/clippy/test/release).

Stage Summary:
- M2 is effectively proven end-to-end on CI: real mods load through the real FML pipeline both in the harness and inside the live Paper 26.3 boot.
- Next: green boot on 8775439-fix, then M2 parity ground-truth (real NeoForge 21.1.265 server run) + M2.1 annotation descriptors.

---
Task ID: 3.5
Agent: main
Task: shadow-space log pipeline fix + M2 parity ground-truth job

Work Log:
- Shadow log4j was silent: (a) getResources returned only the FIRST jar hit — log4j aggregates plugin caches per jar (Log4j2Plugins.dat lives in META-INF/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/plugins/ in 2.22.1) and ServiceLoader needs all providers — without log4j-core's dat, 0 core converters load, layouts fail, log lines drop; (b) no config → DefaultConfiguration.
- Fixes: ShadowClassLoader.getResources now enumerates ALL jars (hermetic, MR-aware); scoped log4j2 config via log4j2.component.properties packaged in cim-bootstrap.jar (visible only to the shadow loader) + scripts/log4j2-layer.xml at process CWD.
- Result: [cim-layer] INFO lines in harness output incl. first-party markers "[cimtest] mod constructed (registration queues armed)" and "[cimtest] common setup ok (block=cimtest:test_block, ...)". Harness re-verified: mod execution ok, 946 ms.
- integration.yml: [cim-layer] marker assertions in boot + m2-real-mods jobs; NEW parity-real-neoforge job — REAL NeoForge 21.1.265 dedicated server boots the SAME mod set (real Modrinth mods + cimtest); the [cimtest] markers are the cross-boot parity contract.

Stage Summary:
- Shadow space now logs through its own (scoped) slf4j→log4j2 stack; parity contract established with the real server.
- Pushed: f8eec68 (assert format fix) + log-pipeline + parity job.

---
Task ID: 3.6
Agent: main
Task: CI round 2 — boot + parity GREEN, harness path fix

Work Log:
- integration 4071465: boot Paper (8 real mods, [cim-layer] markers) GREEN; parity-real-neoforge (real NeoForge 21.1.265 server, same mod set, [cimtest] markers) GREEN on first run; m2-real-mods harness failed on a relative-path bug in run-m2-harness.sh (cd into OUT broke the manifest path).
- Fix: script resolves LAYER/MODS/OUT to absolute paths up front. Verified locally with a nested relative out dir.
- docs/ROADMAP.md: M2 section rewritten to DONE status with the M2.0 design summary + acceptance evidence.

Stage Summary:
- M2 effectively complete and proven on CI from three angles: harness, live Paper boot, real NeoForge parity server. Remaining: green harness job on the path fix + M2.1 annotation toggle.

---
Task ID: 3.7
Agent: main
Task: /cim status bridge — module persists status.json, Paper plugin renders it

Work Log:
- lib.rs: run_bootstrap result (combined nested status JSON) persisted to <server_root>/c-imagine/status.json (non-fatal on failure).
- paper-plugin CimPlugin: /cim status renders the file (regex extraction, no JSON deps on the Paper side); plugin.yml untouched.
- integration boot job: python assertion on srv/c-imagine/status.json (init + mods ok).
- cargo check/clippy -D warnings clean.

Stage Summary:
- M2 acceptance surface complete: mods run (harness + live boot), parity server green, /cim status bridge file contract in place.

---
Task ID: 3.8
Agent: main
Task: M2 closure — all integration jobs green on CI

Work Log:
- integration 8954c6c + e88c713: FULLY GREEN (ci, visual, integration).
- Three-way proof of M2: (1) m2-real-mods harness — 8 mods through real FML in the shadow space; (2) live boot — same set inside the Paper 26.3 JVM via CRUSSTY with status.json bridge asserted; (3) parity-real-neoforge — real NeoForge 21.1.265 server prints identical [cimtest] markers.

Stage Summary:
- M2 DONE (M2.1 annotation toggle tracked as follow-up).
- Next: M3 — state bridge v1 (block read/write through Paper, entity projection, Paper tick scheduler).

---
Task ID: 3.9
Agent: main
Task: M3.1 kernel state bridge — place/break across the two worlds (facade v1)

Work Log:
- Design zero-RegisterNatives: module poll thread resolves dev.cim.paper.CimPlugin via JVMTI classes::find_class, resolves the plugin INSTANCE through Bukkit.getServer().getPluginManager().getPlugin, polls isWorldReady(), then invokes KernelBridge.runSmoke(pluginObj) on the bootstrap loader — the facade reflects on the plugin BY NAME (String/primitive values only; no shared types).
- crates/imagine/src/kernel_bridge.rs: poll loop + JNI plumbing (leaked global ref of the bootstrap URLClassLoader; 'static GlobalRef for the plugin object).
- dev/cim/bridge/KernelBridge.java: synchronous facade — vanilla states pass through; modded ids (cimtest:*) → sidecar record + Paper stand-in (minecraft:structure_void); air clears the sidecar (break).
- CimPlugin: isWorldReady (ServerLoadEvent), worldName, layerGetBlock/layerSetBlock/paperSetAir with a main-thread hop (callSyncMethod) since bridge callers run on module threads; /cim extended with bridge state.
- boot job: builds the paper plugin (mvn) and deploys it into srv/plugins/; assertions for all four smoke markers (vanilla roundtrip, modded stand-in, paper-side break observed by layer, ALL OK).
- clippy -D warnings clean; release build ok; harness still green (957 ms).

Stage Summary:
- M3.1 bridge ready for the live-boot CI validation (place via layer -> Paper sees it; break via Paper -> layer observes).

---
Task ID: 3.10
Agent: main
Task: CI round 3 — paper-api 26.3 surface drift fix

Work Log:
- paper-plugin compile failure on CI: Block#setAir(boolean) no longer exists in paper-api 26.3 — replaced with setType(Material.AIR) (void return wrapped).
- Harness + parity jobs stayed green; only the plugin surface drifted.

Stage Summary:
- Pushing fix; expecting full green on the next run (bridge smoke runs in the live boot).

---
Task ID: 3.11
Agent: main
Task: boot job artifact name fix

Work Log:
- pom finalName is cim-paper-plugin (no version suffix) — cp path corrected.

Stage Summary:
- Expecting full green; bridge smoke markers next.

---
Task ID: 3.12
Agent: main
Task: bridge race fix — Bukkit class loads before the server instance exists

Work Log:
- CI boot.log artifact: "getPluginManager: Null pointer in call_method obj argument" — the bridge thread resolved Bukkit the moment the CLASS loaded, before Bukkit.setServer()/plugin enable.
- Fix: plugin-instance resolution now retries (1s cadence, 5 min deadline) until getServer() and getPlugin("c-imagine") are both live; world-ready poll unchanged.

Stage Summary:
- Bridge lifecycle: class online -> instance online -> world ready -> smoke.
